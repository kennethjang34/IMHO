#With IMHO, share your humble opinion!

IMHO provides a platform where you can upload posts and leave comments to share your humble opinions!

IMHO supports image upload as well. 

IMHO currently supports login authentication through Google OAuth 2.0 APIs (accounts.google.com). The authentication data is stored in the client side and managed with NGRX, a powerful tool that provides redux-like environment for Angular applications. 

Please refer to the video attached below to check out the current state of IMHO!
